This is a NET trading tool made to support NET miners to increase their mined volume.

cryptsy.php -> cryptsy api same as in cryptsy.com
tool.php -> "arbitrage" functions
NET-LTC-XPM-NET.php -> file for this loop

This project depends on a webserver with php support, If you use this on a public server you _MUST_ use a .htaccess to protect the directory with a password, you have to fill your apikey and secret in cryptsy.php then run NET-LTC-XPM-NET.php.

At this time the app have bugs when the lowest volume loop is net/ltc, the other possible lowest markets are working well and will print out all the info needed to place the orders.
