cryptsy.php -> cryptsy api wrapper and pyramid code
index.html -> javascript interface to access cryptsy.php
NET-LTC-BTC-XPM-NET.php -> bug infested implementation with execute buttons
NET-LTC-XPM-NET.php -> latest pyramid example code *main work in progress*

The idea is to call volumeFinder(0, 108, 106, 104); if it output a net volume run it again with that net vomlume instead of 0, if it outputs a profit value generate orders else run itself again with the new return. If I can make this volumeFinder() consistent against the market I will work on the execute buttons.

this is not bugfree, I am not responsible for any loss you might have by using this software, by using this you agree to take full responsability.
